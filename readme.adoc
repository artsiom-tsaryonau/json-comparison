== Description
The application performs the comparison of two binary `base64` encoded JSON strings and returns the differences between them.

IMPORTANT: As original requirements directly mention JSON, the naming in the project relies on JsonXXXX.

== Workflow
The algorithm of performing the comparison using the application looks like this

* user uploads left side of comparison and the right side of the comparison using `POST` requests
* user asks the application for the comparison result using `GET` requesta
* application performs comparison of `left` and `right` side character by character and returns the result in JSON format
* result represents the decision of the application regarding two strings

IMPORTANT: Comparison consists of the `left` side of comparison and the `right` side of comparison.

There are several possible decisions

.Possible decisions
|===
| Message

| JSON binary data is different
| JSON binary data has different size
| JSON binary data is the same
|===

=== Example
Let's say we want to compare two strings that look like this

.Example data
[%header, cols="1d, 3a"]
|===
| Comparison  | Data
| Left side   | eyJuYW1lIjoic3VybmFtZSJ9
| Right side  | eyJuYW1lIjoic3VybmVtZSJ9
|===
The result of the comparison will look like this
----
{
  "status": "OK",
  "content": {
    "ID": "MY_ID",
    "result": "JSON binary data is different",
    "differences": "[startIndex=18:length=1]"
  }
}
----

====
*Explanation*

Between
----
eyJuYW1lIjoic3VybmFtZSJ9
----
and
----
eyJuYW1lIjoic3VybmVtZSJ9
----
The only difference is a single symbol
----
eyJuYW1lIjoic3Vybm|F|tZSJ9
eyJuYW1lIjoic3Vybm|V|tZSJ9
----
That difference starts at index `18` (0-based indexing) and has `length = 1`. And the `result` JSON provides information about that.
====

== API
The core of the application is three endpoints

.Endpoints
[cols="2d, 1a, 3d"]
|===
| Endpoint | Method | Description

| /v1/diff/<ID>/left
| POST
| Uploads left side of comparison

| /v1/diff/<ID>/right
| POST
| Uploads right side of comparison

| /v1/diff/<ID>
| GET
| Returns comparison result
|===

=== Uploading comparison data
REST expects the body containing the base64 encoded string (or any string other string).

[TIP]
====
The <ID> can have any value. In case not existing <ID> in `POST` requests the application will create it
====
Both `POST` endpoints provide the same responses. In case of success the response looks like this
----
{
    "status": "OK",
    "content": "Successfully stored"
}
----

====
*There are several error responses*

.Attempt to update finished comparison
----
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "content": "Cannot update completed comparison with id [<ID>]"
}
----
.Not specified internal error
----
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "content": "Internal server error"
}
----
====

=== Retrieving results
All responses from `GET` endpoint have similar structure. They are either look like this
----
{
  "status": "<STATUS_CODE>",
  "content": {
    "ID": "<ID>",
    "result": "<DECISION>"
  }
}
----
or like this
----
{
  "status": "<STATUS_CODE>",
  "content": {
    "ID": "<ID>",
    "result": "<DECISION>",
    "differences": "<INDEX_OFFSET>"
  }
}
----
IMPORTANT: response field `differences` is available only for the decision `JSON binary data is different`.

====
*There are several error responses*

.No comparison found by id
----
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "content": "No comparison with id [<ID>] found"
}
----
.When some of sides are missing
----
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "content": "Cannot perform comparison <ID> as [<side>] are missing"
}
----
.Not specified internal error
----
{
    "status": "ERROR",
    "content": "Internal server error"
}

== How to Run
=== For Windows
----
start.bat
----
or
----
gradlew bootRun
----
=== For Linux
----
./gradlew bootRun
----
By default application is running on `8080` port. You can change it by providing the argument `port` when executing tasks.

==== Example
----
gradlew bootRun -Pport=8081
----
This will start application on port 8081

== Swagger
By default application is running on `8080`.
You can access `swagger` documentation and try REST endpoints by going to
----
http://localhost:8080
